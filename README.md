# Smart Goal Planner

#### A simple goal planning application built using React JS to allow users to manage multiple savings goals, allocate deposits across them, and track progress toward each goal.

#### By **Samuel Kiplangat**

## Description

This is a minimalist management application built using React JS. The application will fetch and persist all goal data from a local db.json file, simulated using json-server. This allows for full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality.
